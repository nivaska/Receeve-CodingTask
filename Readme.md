I am storing the copies of webhook data on a S3 storage bucket.

The output directory for the build is /dist.
Before building the app, please enter the config information in the "config.json" file.
The config file requires values for the Mailgun Signing Key, S3 bucket name and access keys and a topic name for SNS.
